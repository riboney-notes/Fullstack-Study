# The Object-Oriented Thought Process

*Book - [Link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/object-oriented-thought-process/9780135182130/)*

## 1: Intro to Object-Oriented Concepts

### Fundamental Concepts

- Object Oriented langauges are defined by the following concepts:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Composition (*note: added by the author; the other three are the main OO concepts*)

- If a language does not implement the 3 OOP concepts, then its not considered to be completely a OO langauge

### Objects and legacy systems

- Alot of early systems were writting using the procedural programming style
- OOP style of programming came out of the 90s with the onset of Internet based applications
  - Transferring data via the internet was best done with OOP
- Object wrappers
  - where you take structured code and wrap it inside an object to make it look like an object
  - Legacy systems written in procedural style can be converted to OOP via object wrappers

### Procedural vs OO programming
- Characteristics of OOP 
  - Encapsulation
    - combination of attributes and methods in the same entity
  - Data Hiding
    - restricting access to attributes and methods
    - getters and setters
- Characteristics of Structured (procedural) programming 
  - Modular
    - programs are divided into small programs or functions 
  - Separation of attributes and behaviors
    - functions are stored modules or programs
    - data is stored in data structures (arraY) and primitives
  - Data is global
    - access to data is uncontrolled

### Conculusion

- *Some sections were skipped*
- Composition: the building of objects with other objects
