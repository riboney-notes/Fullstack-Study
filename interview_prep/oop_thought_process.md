## Intro to Object-Oriented Concepts

### Fundamental Concepts

- Object Oriented langauges are defined by the following concepts:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Composition (*note: this one is added by the author*)

- If a language does not implement encapsualtion, inheritance, or polymorphism, then its not considered to be completely a OO langauge

### Objects and legacy systems
 
- Characteristics of Structured (procedural) programming 
  - programs are divided into small programs or functions (modules)
  - all about creating readable code and reusable components
  - methods are written globally and code lines are processed sequentially
  - less abstraction and flexibility than OOP
  - more diffult to refactor

- Object wrappers
  - where you take structured code and wrap it inside an object to make it look like an object

### Procedural vs OO programming
- OOP is designed around objects that consists of attributes and behaviors
- Procedural programming is designed around functions that are separate from data which is stored into separate structures and manipulated by functions
- Data is often global in procedural programming so access to data is uncontrolled and unpredictable
  - Objects address this issue by combing
