**Basic Software Engineering steps**

- Rqeuirements gathering
  - what the customers want/need
  - good for keeping project development on track (prevent feature-creep)
- High-level design
  - decisions about project architecture, organization, and tools that will help satisfy customer requriements
- Low-level design
  - information for developers that guide developers in implementing high-level design
- Development
  - implemnting the low-level design 
- Testing
  - testing ensures the program is working as intended
  - helps find bugs, since the longer a bug remains undetected, the harder it is to fix
    - this is because things are connected and dependent on each other; so if theres a bug in one part, then there will be many other bugs as a result of dependencys
- Deployment
  - releasing software for customers use
- Maintenance
  - enhancements, bug fixes, improvements, etc
- Wrap up
  - evaluate the project and decide what went right and wrong, which is useful for the future
- How SWE differs from other kinds of engineering
- How bug fixes can cause other bugs
  - it could be that a bug fix is incorrect or the fix breaks another piece of code that depended on the original buggy behavior
  - tests can prevent bug fixes from causing other bugs by making sure everything works as it should
- Why detecting mistakes early as possible is important
  - mistakes can propagate and cause more mistakes since processes are dependent on each other
