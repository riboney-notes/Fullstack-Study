## 1: Defining Project MGMT Fundamentals

*Objectives*
- Identify basic concepts and terminology of professional project management
- Identify and describe the phases and components of the project life cycle
- Identify and describe the organizational influences on project management.
- Define the Agile methodology

### A: Identify Project MGMT Basics

**Project**

- temporary work endeavor that creates a unique product, service, or result

**Subprojects**

- independently manageable component of an existing project

**Project Management**

- planned effort for executing and monitoring a project in order to accomplish its defined goals and objectives
- Ex: scheduling, identifying requirements, establishing objectives, balancing quality, scope, time, and cost, and addressing the concerns and expectations of the stakeholders
- Differs from management of *operations*
  - routine, ongoing work dealing with the day-to-day production of goods and services

**Programs**

- group of related projects that have a common obj
- managed by program manager vs project managers who manage projects

**Portfolio**

- collection of projects, programs, and operational work to achieve the strategic business obj of an organization
- Program vs portfolio
  - Programs includes related & interdependent projects
  - Portfolio includes unrelated projects

**Operations**

- ongoing, repetitive tasks that produce the same outcome every time they are performed
- Projects vs operations
  - Projects:
    - one time effort
    - unique product or service
  - Operations:
    - ongoing effort
    - repetitive product or service

**PMO**

- Project Management Office (PMO) is a centralized, permanent, ongoing adminsitrative unit or department that serves to improve project mgmt performance within an organization
- provides support for project mgmt concepts, tools, training, etc
- maintains standards provide governance, and improve efficiency
- has authority to make key decisions
- monitors budget and timelines

**Project Stakeholders**

- person who has a vested interest in the outcome of a project or who is actively involved in its work

**Customers/end-users**

- project stakeholder type that will receive the product/ service generated by the project

**Sponsor/champion**

- project stakeholder type that provide finances, mgmt support, and overall control of the project

**Portfolio manager/ review board**

- project stakeholder type that belong to the high-level project governance and reviews things like ROI, value, risks, etc

**Program managers (project stakeholder type)**

- works with project managers and manage related projects in a program to obtain maximum benefits

**Project Management Office (project stakeholder type)**:

- adminstrative unit that supervises and coordinates the mgmt of all projects in an organization

**Project Manager (project stakeholder type)**

- individuals responsible for managing all aspects of the project

**Project MGMT team**

- project stakeholder type where members of the project team who perform mgmt activities 

**Project Coordinator**

- project stakeholder type that exists when full-scale project manager is not needed

**Scheduler**

- project stakeholder type that creates and maintains the project timeline using software or tools

**project team**

- project stakeholder type that compises of multiple individuals that are involved in the project

**Vendors/ partners**

- project stakeholder type that are external parties who enter into a contractual agreement with the organization

**functional managers**

- project stakeholder type that provide resources (people) to the project managers who in turn assign them to project activities; ex: department heads

**Operations managers**

- project stakeholder type that manage the core business area

**Positive & negative stakeholders**

- Ex: Postive stakeholder can be the business people who will profit and the negative stakeholder can be the environmentalist group that considers the project to be harmful

### 1B: Describe the project life cycle

**process**

- sequence of activities designed to bring about a specific result in response to a business need

**Project mgmt processes

- all activities that underlie the effective practice of project mgmt; they are grouped into intiating/ pre-project setup, planning, executing, montioring/ controlling, and clsing a project

**Project Life Cylce Phases/ process groups**

- _Initiating_ - defining need for project, assignment of managers and reps, goals and objectives, etc 
- _planning_ - addressing scope, time, cost, risk, etc and refining objectives and developing strategy
- _executing_ - carrying out work mentioned in project planning
- _monitoring/ controlling_ - regular monitoring of project performance and tracking progress made and getting back on track when needed
- _closing_ - finalzing project activies, and cleaning up

**Tailoring**

- determining which processes are appropriate for a given project

**Project Prototyping**
- process of creating a mock-up of a product or system

**Proof-of-principle**
- prototyping model that enables you to check some aspects of product design without considering the visual appearance, materials to be used, or the manufacturing process

**Form study**
- prototyping model that enables you to check the primary size and appearance of a product without simulating its exact function or design

**visual**
- prototyping model that enables you to check the design and imitate the appearnace, color, and surface textures of the product but will not contain the funcitons of the final product

**functional**
- prototyping model that enables you to check the apperance, materials, and functionality of the expected design

**Project stages**
- group of related project activities that results in the completion of a major deliverable

**Project governance**
- comprehensive methodology to cotnrol a project and ensure its success

**Phase-gate review**
- aka governance-gate review; a checkpoint review of project deliverables and performance that occurs at the end of each phase of a project where a mgmt review or sign-off may be required

**Quality-gate**
- ...

**phase-to-phase relationship types**
- sequential
- overlapping
- iterative

**progressive elaboration**
- process of increasing the level of detail in a project management plan as more information and more accurate estimates become available

**rolling wave planning**
- technique in which work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, whereas future work is planned with much less detail; as time progresses, the "wave" rolls forward so near-term work is always planned in more detail

### 1C: Identify organizational influences on project management

**organizational process assets**
- entitites that can be used to influence the sucess of a project
- Ex: policies, guidelines, schedules, risk data, etc
- Two categories
  - processes and procedures
  - corporate knowledge base

**Enterprise environmental factors**
- internal or external factors that can have a postive or negatuve influence on the project outcome
- Ex: culture, marketplace ocnidtions, political situations, etc

**Expert Judgement**
- advice provided by individuals having expertise in a specific knowledge area, an application area, industry, or discipline

**Project interfaces**
- various reporting relationships that occur within a project and on the boundaries of the project
- organizational (ie between managers of groups)
- technical (ie between backend and frontend)
- interpersonal (ie between project members)
- logistical (ie relationships between project team  members in different parts of the world)

**Organizational structure**
- compositional makeup of an organization that describes how various groups and individuals within the organization interrelate

**organization chart**
- visual representation of a project's organizational structure
- shows reporting relationships within the project and project's relationship to the parent organization

**Functional organizational structure**
- Each department is responsible for carrying out a specific similiar set of activities
- multiple people perform each type of activity
- reporting is hierarchical, with each individual reporting to a single manager
  - team members report only to their functional manager
  - project manager reports to functional manager
- Project manager is parttime; team members are parttime
- project manager's authority is low, relative to the functional manager's authority
- inefficient project organization
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/157568827-20a8ea26-db53-4b64-8faf-eb6fcd062dcb.png)

**Matrix organizational Structure**
- mix of functional and projectized when it comes to reporting
- reporting scheme may be permanent or temporary
- It being weak, balanced, or strong depends on the relative authority of project manager to the functional manager
  - ex: Strong matrix if project manager's authority is higher than that of the functional manager
- Project manager is fulltime; team members are part time
- Costly and complex but effective
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/157569452-6dee804e-7313-4f8e-a5b6-db971c087ee3.png)

**Projectized organizational structure**
- where project manager and core project team operate as a complete separate organizational unit within the parent organization
  - don't belong to a department so they are loyal only to the project
- team members are co-located
- project manager reports to program manager
- project manager has significant amount of authority and independence
- efficient project organization
- Ex: consulting firms or engineering firms
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/157569759-7b3c7fd1-5341-4c86-b6dd-4fe69079ceaf.png)

**composite organizational structure**
- combination of all the other types of organziations

**Relative authority in organizational structures**
- refers to the project manager's authority relative to the functional manager's authority over a project and project team

### 3B: Determine stakeholder needs

- important to identify stakeholder needs since if they are not in agreement about preojct expectations, timelines, costs, etc, then they will not be satisified with outcome of project
- project objectives
  - criteria used to measure whether a project is successful or not
  - characterisics of project objectives:
    - specific in terms of scope
    - quantifiable in terms of time, cost, and quality

  - changing one constraint factor should include changing other factors to account for the impact from changing
  - Contraints triangle: time, cost, scope = quality

- product analysis
  - evaluation of the project's end product and what it will take to create the project
  - techniques
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/163408662-d74f7049-1232-4b98-80eb-16858e8907ef.png)

## 4: Preparing to Develop the Project Schedule

*Objectives*
- Develop a WBS
- Create an activity list
- Identify the relationships b/w activities
- Identify resources
- Estimate time

### 4A: Develop a WBS

- Why create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
  - makes it easier to complete a project
  - helps improve the accuracy of time, cost, and resource estimates by providing baseline for performance measurement and project control
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - provides logical grouping of project deliverables arranged in a hierarchical structure and defines the total scope of work required
  - major components
    - major project deliverables
    - life cycle phases
    - organization or functional responsibility
    - geographical location
- work package
  - smallest, most granular deliverable that is represented on the WBS thta describes a deliverable that can be assigned to a person or group
- wbs dictionary
  - document that contains details about each element in the WBS
- decomposition
  - technique for creating WBS by subdividing project work to the work package level
- code of accounts
  - any system that us used for numbering the elements in a WBS that helps project managers to easily track individual WBS components
- scope baseline
  - describes the need, justification, requirements, and boundaries for the project
- Guidelines to create Work Breakdown Structure
  - _skipped..._

### 4B: Create an activity list

- Why
  - defining activities can mitigate project creep
  - helps ensure that all project activities remain within the project scope
- Duration
  - amount of time that a particular task or work package will take to complete
  - _fixed duration_ - describes task/work package that requires a set amount of time; not affected by application of additional resources
  - _elapsed time_ - actual calendar time required for an activity from start to finish (ex: if activity takes 2 weeks to complete, then elapsed time may be 4 weeks if there is a 2 week shutdown)
- Effort
  - measure of labor that must be applied to the completion of a particular task or work package; expressed as resources * time (Ex: person-hours, person-days, etc) 
  - _effort-driven_ - describes a task where the effort/ work remains fixed regardless of the number of resources used to complete the work (?); more labor resources, more quickly task can be completed
- 8/80 rule
  - general guideline regarding work packages that they require more than 8 and fewer than 80 hours of effort to be completed
  - used to identify which work components should be considered to be work packages 
- activity
  - smaller, manageable, and executable components broken down/subdivided from work packages that requires action to produce a deliverable 
  - lays foundation for estimating, scheduling, executing, and monitoring, and controlling the project work
  - has expected duration
  - consumes budgets and human resources
- activity list
  - definitive lists of activities that must be completed to produce the desired project deliverables
  - used to create the project schedule 
- milestone
  - control point event in a project with zero duration that triggers a reporting requirement or requires sponsor/customer approval before proceeding with the project 
- milestone list
  - document that contains the project milestones and inidcates if achieving the milestone is mandatory or optional for the project to move to the next phase
  - used as indicators of a project's progress and the goals that must be reached 
- entry/exit criteria
  - conditions that are required to enter into or exit from a particular milestone 

### 4C: Identify the relationships between activities
