## 1: Defining Project MGMT Fundamentals

*Objectives*
- Identify basic concepts and terminology of professional project management
- Identify and describe the phases and components of the project life cycle
- Identify and describe the organizational influences on project management.
- Define the Agile methodology

### A: Identify Project MGMT Basics

**Project**

- temporary work endeavor that creates a unique product, service, or result

**Subprojects**

- independently manageable component of an existing project

**Project Management**

- planned effort for executing and monitoring a project in order to accomplish its defined goals and objectives
- Ex: scheduling, identifying requirements, establishing objectives, balancing quality, scope, time, and cost, and addressing the concerns and expectations of the stakeholders
- Differs from management of *operations*
  - routine, ongoing work dealing with the day-to-day production of goods and services

**Programs**

- group of related projects that have a common obj
- managed by program manager vs project managers who manage projects

**Portfolio**

- collection of projects, programs, and operational work to achieve the strategic business obj of an organization
- Program vs portfolio
  - Programs includes related & interdependent projects
  - Portfolio includes unrelated projects

**Operations**

- ongoing, repetitive tasks that produce the same outcome every time they are performed
- Projects vs operations
  - Projects:
    - one time effort
    - unique product or service
  - Operations:
    - ongoing effort
    - repetitive product or service

**PMO**

- Project Management Office (PMO) is a centralized, permanent, ongoing adminsitrative unit or department that serves to improve project mgmt performance within an organization
- provides support for project mgmt concepts, tools, training, etc
- maintains standards provide governance, and improve efficiency
- has authority to make key decisions
- monitors budget and timelines

**Project Stakeholders**

- person who has a vested interest in the outcome of a project or who is actively involved in its work

**Customers/end-users**

- project stakeholder type that will receive the product/ service generated by the project

**Sponsor/champion**

- project stakeholder type that provide finances, mgmt support, and overall control of the project

**Portfolio manager/ review board**

- project stakeholder type that belong to the high-level project governance and reviews things like ROI, value, risks, etc

**Program managers (project stakeholder type)**

- works with project managers and manage related projects in a program to obtain maximum benefits

**Project Management Office (project stakeholder type)**:

- adminstrative unit that supervises and coordinates the mgmt of all projects in an organization

**Project Manager (project stakeholder type)**

- individuals responsible for managing all aspects of the project

**Project MGMT team**

- project stakeholder type where members of the project team who perform mgmt activities 

**Project Coordinator**

- project stakeholder type that exists when full-scale project manager is not needed

**Scheduler**

- project stakeholder type that creates and maintains the project timeline using software or tools

**project team**

- project stakeholder type that compises of multiple individuals that are involved in the project

**Vendors/ partners**

- project stakeholder type that are external parties who enter into a contractual agreement with the organization

**functional managers**

- project stakeholder type that provide resources (people) to the project managers who in turn assign them to project activities; ex: department heads

**Operations managers**

- project stakeholder type that manage the core business area

**Positive & negative stakeholders**

- Ex: Postive stakeholder can be the business people who will profit and the negative stakeholder can be the environmentalist group that considers the project to be harmful

### 1B: Describe the project life cycle

**process**

- sequence of activities designed to bring about a specific result in response to a business need

**Project mgmt processes

- all activities that underlie the effective practice of project mgmt; they are grouped into intiating/ pre-project setup, planning, executing, montioring/ controlling, and clsing a project

**Project Life Cylce Phases/ process groups**

- _Initiating_ - defining need for project, assignment of managers and reps, goals and objectives, etc 
- _planning_ - addressing scope, time, cost, risk, etc and refining objectives and developing strategy
- _executing_ - carrying out work mentioned in project planning
- _monitoring/ controlling_ - regular monitoring of project performance and tracking progress made and getting back on track when needed
- _closing_ - finalzing project activies, and cleaning up

**Tailoring**

- determining which processes are appropriate for a given project

**Project Prototyping**
- process of creating a mock-up of a product or system

**Proof-of-principle**
- prototyping model that enables you to check some aspects of product design without considering the visual appearance, materials to be used, or the manufacturing process

**Form study**
- prototyping model that enables you to check the primary size and appearance of a product without simulating its exact function or design

**visual**
- prototyping model that enables you to check the design and imitate the appearnace, color, and surface textures of the product but will not contain the funcitons of the final product

**functional**
- prototyping model that enables you to check the apperance, materials, and functionality of the expected design

**Project stages**
- group of related project activities that results in the completion of a major deliverable

**Project governance**
- comprehensive methodology to cotnrol a project and ensure its success

**Phase-gate review**
- aka governance-gate review; a checkpoint review of project deliverables and performance that occurs at the end of each phase of a project where a mgmt review or sign-off may be required

**Quality-gate**
- ...

**phase-to-phase relationship types**
- sequential
- overlapping
- iterative

**progressive elaboration**
- process of increasing the level of detail in a project management plan as more information and more accurate estimates become available

**rolling wave planning**
- technique in which work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, whereas future work is planned with much less detail; as time progresses, the "wave" rolls forward so near-term work is always planned in more detail

### 1C: Identify organizational influences on project management

**organizational process assets**
- entitites that can be used to influence the sucess of a project
- Ex: policies, guidelines, schedules, risk data, etc
- Two categories
  - processes and procedures
  - corporate knowledge base

**Enterprise environmental factors**
- internal or external factors that can have a postive or negatuve influence on the project outcome
- Ex: culture, marketplace ocnidtions, political situations, etc

**Expert Judgement**
- advice provided by individuals having expertise in a specific knowledge area, an application area, industry, or discipline

**Project interfaces**
- various reporting relationships that occur within a project and on the boundaries of the project
- organizational (ie between managers of groups)
- technical (ie between backend and frontend)
- interpersonal (ie between project members)
- logistical (ie relationships between project team  members in different parts of the world)

**Organizational structure**
- compositional makeup of an organization that describes how various groups and individuals within the organization interrelate

**organization chart**
- visual representation of a project's organizational structure
- shows reporting relationships within the project and project's relationship to the parent organization

**Functional organizational structure**
- Each department is responsible for carrying out a specific similiar set of activities
- multiple people perform each type of activity
- reporting is hierarchical, with each individual reporting to a single manager
  - team members report only to their functional manager
  - project manager reports to functional manager
- Project manager is parttime; team members are parttime
- project manager's authority is low, relative to the functional manager's authority
- inefficient project organization
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/157568827-20a8ea26-db53-4b64-8faf-eb6fcd062dcb.png)

**Matrix organizational Structure**
- mix of functional and projectized when it comes to reporting
- reporting scheme may be permanent or temporary
- It being weak, balanced, or strong depends on the relative authority of project manager to the functional manager
  - ex: Strong matrix if project manager's authority is higher than that of the functional manager
- Project manager is fulltime; team members are part time
- Costly and complex but effective
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/157569452-6dee804e-7313-4f8e-a5b6-db971c087ee3.png)

**Projectized organizational structure**
- where project manager and core project team operate as a complete separate organizational unit within the parent organization
  - don't belong to a department so they are loyal only to the project
- team members are co-located
- project manager reports to program manager
- project manager has significant amount of authority and independence
- efficient project organization
- Ex: consulting firms or engineering firms
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/157569759-7b3c7fd1-5341-4c86-b6dd-4fe69079ceaf.png)

**composite organizational structure**
- combination of all the other types of organziations

**Relative authority in organizational structures**
- refers to the project manager's authority relative to the functional manager's authority over a project and project team
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/157569991-b68b2c25-27cf-410d-b959-dacccd63aac0.png)

</details>

- _Note: Chapter involves creating project charter as an exercise_

### 2D: Identify Project Stakeholders

- Why?
  - important to get relevant information on stakeholder interests and expectations since they influence the outcome of the project

- stakeholder analysis
  - formal process of identifying all the stakeholders of a project and their needs, objectives, goals, issues, and impact
  - Steps:
    - Identify all potential stakeholders of a project
    - Classify stakeholders based on their potential impact or support on the project
    - Create plans for managing stakeholders reactions and responses
- stakeholder register
  - document that identifies stakeholders of a project

  - Create stakeholder management strategy
- _Note_: this chapter has an activity for identifying project stakeholders

## 3: Planning the Project

*Objectives*
- Identify the elements of the project mgmt plan and subsidiary plans
- Determine stakeholder needs
- Create a scope statement

### 3A: Identify project management plan components

- project management plan
  - document that details how a project will be executed to achieve its objectives
  - Components
    - Description of project mgmt processes and their implementation, tools, and techniques
    - Plans for monitoring and managing changes
    - Details on configuration mgmt
    - Details on how project performance (scope, time, cost) will be controlled
    - Techniques for stakeholder communications
    - Project Life Cycle definition
    - Plan for identifying, documenting, and addressing open issues
- subsidiary plans
  - whereas a project mgmt plan is general, subsidary plans are more detailed and focused
  - scope mgmt plan
  - requirements mgmt plan
  - schedule mgmt plan
  - cost mgmt plan
  - quality mgmt plan
  - process improvement plan
    - describes the steps to identify areas of improvements in creating project deliverable
  - human resource plan
    - document that provides guidance on how "human resources" (staff) for the project should be defined, managed, controlled, and released
  - communications mgmt plan
  - risk mgmt plan
  - procurement mgmt plan
    - guidelines for obtaining work from outside sources (ie contracts)

### 3B: Determine stakeholder needs

- important to identify stakeholder needs since if they are not in agreement about preojct expectations, timelines, costs, etc, then they will not be satisified with outcome of project
- project objectives
  - criteria used to measure whether a project is successful or not
  - characterisics of project objectives:
    - specific in terms of scope
    - quantifiable in terms of time, cost, and quality
    - realistic and attainable
    - consistent with organizational plans, policies, and procedures
- customer requirements
  - customer needs and expectations that must be met in order to meet the project objectives
- stakeholder requiremetns collection methods
  - interviewing
  - focus groups
    - trained moderator-guided interactive discussions that include stakeholders and SMEs designed to gather their expectations and attitudes towards project deliverable
  - facilitated workshops
    - group sessions that bring together stakeholders of various backgrounds to define project requirements
    - useful for reconciling differences in viewpoints among different groups
  - group creativity techniques
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/163377349-e42f8377-b8fc-40a4-abd2-5d99f4095e1e.png)    
  - group decision making techniques
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/163377469-2cd95857-0d06-4b89-9ada-2a73ea4d40db.png)

- requirement documentation
  - describes how individual requirements meet the business needs of the project
- Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)
  - table that links project requirements to their origin and traces them throught the project lifecycle
  - ensures requriements are met at the end of the project and provides structure for managing changes to project scope
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/163381492-fcc27cbb-0ba2-4d2b-af81-6a6c64d1c1f6.png)
- Guidelines for determining stakeholder needs
  - Analyze project charter to identify project requirements and product descriptions
  - Examine stakeholder register to identify stakeholders or can provide details for project requirements
  - Gather project requriements via interviews, focus groups, etc
  - Create requriement documentation that explains how requirements meets the business needs for the project
  - Create requirements management plan

### 3C Create a Scope Statement

- scope statement
  - prevents spending time & resources on things that are not related to the project
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/163406453-84ec2e93-859e-43e7-8802-25c3de8d80a7.png)

- Constraints
  - interrelated limitations that concern scope, time, cost, and quality
  - changing one constraint factor should include changing other factors to account for the impact from changing
  - Contraints triangle: time, cost, scope = quality

- product analysis
  - evaluation of the project's end product and what it will take to create the project
  - techniques
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/163408662-d74f7049-1232-4b98-80eb-16858e8907ef.png)

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14286113/163408830-afaadee8-a8e5-4b85-b8da-02aad5d25c90.png)

## 4: Preparing to Develop the Project Schedule

*Objectives*
- Develop a WBS
- Create an activity list
- Identify the relationships b/w activities
- Identify resources
- Estimate time

### 4A: Develop a WBS

- Why create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
  - makes it easier to complete a project
  - helps improve the accuracy of time, cost, and resource estimates by providing baseline for performance measurement and project control
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - provides logical grouping of project deliverables arranged in a hierarchical structure and defines the total scope of work required
  - major components
    - major project deliverables
    - life cycle phases
    - organization or functional responsibility
    - geographical location
- work package
  - smallest, most granular deliverable that is represented on the WBS thta describes a deliverable that can be assigned to a person or group
- wbs dictionary
  - document that contains details about each element in the WBS
- decomposition
  - technique for creating WBS by subdividing project work to the work package level
- code of accounts
  - any system that us used for numbering the elements in a WBS that helps project managers to easily track individual WBS components
- scope baseline
  - describes the need, justification, requirements, and boundaries for the project
- Guidelines to create Work Breakdown Structure
  - _skipped..._

### 4B: Create an activity list

- Why
  - defining activities can mitigate project creep
  - helps ensure that all project activities remain within the project scope
- Duration
  - amount of time that a particular task or work package will take to complete
  - _fixed duration_ - describes task/work package that requires a set amount of time; not affected by application of additional resources
  - _elapsed time_ - actual calendar time required for an activity from start to finish (ex: if activity takes 2 weeks to complete, then elapsed time may be 4 weeks if there is a 2 week shutdown)
- Effort
  - measure of labor that must be applied to the completion of a particular task or work package; expressed as resources * time (Ex: person-hours, person-days, etc) 
  - _effort-driven_ - describes a task where the effort/ work remains fixed regardless of the number of resources used to complete the work (?); more labor resources, more quickly task can be completed
- 8/80 rule
  - general guideline regarding work packages that they require more than 8 and fewer than 80 hours of effort to be completed
  - used to identify which work components should be considered to be work packages 
- activity
  - smaller, manageable, and executable components broken down/subdivided from work packages that requires action to produce a deliverable 
  - lays foundation for estimating, scheduling, executing, and monitoring, and controlling the project work
  - has expected duration
  - consumes budgets and human resources
- activity list
  - definitive lists of activities that must be completed to produce the desired project deliverables
  - used to create the project schedule 
- milestone
  - control point event in a project with zero duration that triggers a reporting requirement or requires sponsor/customer approval before proceeding with the project 
- milestone list
  - document that contains the project milestones and inidcates if achieving the milestone is mandatory or optional for the project to move to the next phase
  - used as indicators of a project's progress and the goals that must be reached 
- entry/exit criteria
  - conditions that are required to enter into or exit from a particular milestone 

### 4C: Identify the relationships between activities

- What?
  - once activity list for project is created, a project schedule network diagram can be created
    - this helps you understand the sequence in which project work must occur 
    - helps avoid unnecessary work and expense 
- activity dependency
  - logical relationship that exists between two project activities
  - indicates whether the start of an activity is contingent upon an event or input form
  - shapes the sequence among project activities
- activity dependency types
  - mandatory dependency
    - inherent to the work itself; usually affected by physical constraints
    - aka "hard logic"
    - ex: Books can't be bound before they are printed 
  - discretionary dependency
    - defined by the project and the project management team at their discretion
    - Ex: sponsor would like to see the book's cover design ASAP so book cover artwork would be placed before inside illustrations in the sequence
  - external dependency
    - contingent on inputs from outside the project activities
    - can be mandatory or discretionary
    - Ex:  book can't be printed until shipment of paper arrives
  - internal dependency
    - contingent on inputs from within the organization
    - can be mandatory or discretionary 
- precedence relationship
  - logical relationship between two activities that describes the sequence in which the activities should be carried out 
  - predecessor activity - start
  - successor activity - end
- dependency determination
  - identification of the dependencies of one activity over the otehr
  - involves establishing the precedence relationships among activities and creating logical sequences
- Precedence relationship types
  - finish-to-start (FS)
    - where the predecessor activity (A) must finish before the sucessor activity can start (B)
    - Time = A + B 
  - finish-to-finish (FF)
    -  where the predecessor activity must finish before the successor activity can finish
    -  Time = based on when B begins
    -  Ex: construction (A) must be finished before the building inspection (B) can be finished
  - start-to-start (SS)
    - where the predecessor activity must start before the successor activity can start 
    - Time = based on latest finish time of A or B
    - Ex: Building design (A) must start before Electrical layout design (B) can start
  - start-to-finish (SF)
    - where the predecessor activity must start before the successor activity can finish  
    - Successor activity begins before the predecessor activity
    - Time = A + B
    - Ex: electrical inspections (A) must start before drywalling is finished (B)
- lag
  - delay in the start of a successor activity
  - can be intentional and required
  - determined by external or mandatory dependency  
  - Increases elapsed time for activities
- lead
  - change in logical relationship that allows the successor activity to start before the predecessor activity ends in an FS relationship
  - implemented when successor activity needs to be accelerated in order to shorten project schedule
  - negative lag
  - risk of rework
  - Ex: programming web page before design is completed 
- project schedule network diagram
  - graphical representation of the sequence of project activities and the dependencies among them
- precedence diagramming method (PDM)
  - project schedule network diagramming method that uses rectangular boxes or nodes to represent activities and arrows to represent precedence relationships between activities 
- Summary activity
  - group of related activities that is shown as a single aggregate activity in a bar chart or graph, for reporting purposes 
  - aka Hammock Activity
- Conditional diagramming methods
  - any network diagramming method that allows for non-sequential activities such as loops or conditional branches 
  - loops
    - activity sequences that must be revisisted or repeated 
  - conditional branches
    - activities that will be implemented only under specific conditions 
    - Ex: GERT model
- Graphical Evaluation Review Technique (GERT)

### 4D Identify Resources

- Why?
  - identifying resources will prevent costly mistakes and misunderstandings 
- Project resources
  - any useful materials or people needed to complete the project work
  - Ex: labor, materials, facilities, equipment, consultants, services, supplies, or utilities
  - limited in quantity and require thoughtful allocation
- Project resource types 
  - shared resource
    - resources that are used for multiple projects and must be managed as such 
  - dedicated resource
    - resources that have been committed for your project's use
  - benched resource
    - skilled resources that are retained during downtime but are not incurring costs and can be put into service immediately
  - low quality resource
    - resources that do not possess specialized skills or qualities 
- Resource calendar
  - calendar that lists the time during which project resources can participate in the project tasks
  - prevents resource scheduling conflicts 
- Alternative analysis
  - process of examining different methods of accomplishing activities and determining a preferred method    
- published estimating data
  - information found in commercial publications about production rates, resource cost, and labor requirements
  - can be used to determine resources and resource costs 
- project mgmt software
  - application that generates and organizes resource information, such as cost estimates, work breakdown structures, and project schedules, and so on
  - Ex: Jira, Smartsheet, LiquidPLanner, Microsoft Project, Primavera 
- activity resource requirements
  - descriptions of resources and quantities of resources necessary to complete project activities
  - progressively elaborated when developing human resource plan 
- resource breakdown structure
  - hierarchy of identified resources, organized by category and type
    - category includes labor and equipment
    - type includes skills and grad elevels
  - helps organize and report project schedule information along with the resource utilization data

### 4E: Estimate time

- Why?
  - inaccurate time estimates affects the schedule and prevent overtime work 
- Reserve analysis
  - process of identifying and adding extra time that will serve as contingency or management reserves to the duration estimates   
- Contingency reserves
  - serves as buffers in recognition of scheduled risks or setbacks
  - determined by project manager 
- Mgmt reserves
  - buffers added to the project for unforeseen changes to project scope and costs
  - determined by sponsor 
- Analoguous estimating
  - estimating technique in which managers use their experience, historical information from similiar projects, and expert jugdement to determine the total project cost or time estimate 
  - aka top-down estimaitng
  - used when 
    - limited amount of detailed information about project is available
    - similiar project for comparison exists
    - those preparing estimates have the requisite expertise
- parametric estimating
  - technique that is used to predict duration or cost by using historical data in a mathematical model
  - Ex: if it takes 5 hours to create 5 webpages, then it will take 10 hours (5 * 2) to create 10 webpages 
- three-point estimating
  - method of activity duration estimating in which three types of estimates are incorporated into a singular duration estimate scenario:
    - optimistic
      - best-case estimate of the time required to complete the specified work 
    - most likely
      - time required to complete teh work under normal conditions 
    - pessimistic
      - worst case estimate or the time required if unforseen delays occur
  - Formula: (optimistic + 4(most likely) + pessimistic)/ 6   
- bottom-up estimating
  - method of estimating the duration or cost of each work package in the WBS
  - used when
    - more detail is available about work packages
    - more accurate time estimates are needed
    - time for making estimates is available

## 5: Developing the Project Schedule

**Objectives**
- Develop a project schedule
- Identify the critical path
- Optimize the project schedule
- Create a schedule baseline

### 5A: Develop a Project Schedule

**Why?**
- Project schedules are one of the most important tools for keeping upper management and project stakeholders informed about the project's status and for tracking performance

**Project Schedule**
- project team's plan for starting and finishing activities on specific dates and in a certain sequence
- specifies planned dates for meeting project milestones
- purpose is to coordinate activities to form a master plan in order to complete project objectives on time

**Critical path**
- network path that has the longest duration
- activities on critical path cannot be delayed
  - else, the whole project will be delayed

**Float**
- amount of time an activity can be delayed from its Early Start without delaying the project finish date or consecutive activities
- Only occurs in activities that are not on the critical path
- aka Slack

**Schedule diagramming notations for an activity**
- Early start (ES)
  - earliest time an acitvity can start
  - ES of the first activity in a network diagram is 0
  - ES of all other activities is the latest EF of any predecessor activities
- Early Finish (EF)
  - earliest time an activity can finish
  - EF for the first activity is the same as its duration
  - For all other activities, EF is the lastest EF of all predecessor activities of an activity + duration
- Late Finish (LF)
  - latest time an activity can finish
- Late start (LS)
  - latest time an activity can start
- Duration (DU)
  - number of work periods required for the completion of an activity 

**Total Float**
- type of float where the total amount of time an activity requires can be delayed without delaying the project finish date
- Total Float = LF-EF (or LS-ES)
- Total float for every activity on the critical path is 0

**Free float**
- amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the ES of any activity that immediately folllows it
- it allows flexibility of the start or finish time within that activity only

**Schedule network analysis**
- technique that is used to calculate the theoretical early and late start and finish dates for all project activities
- helps create project schedule


### 5B: Identify the critical path

**Why?**
- Identifying critical path hellps you to determine duration of the entire project
- Also helps with determining which activities have scheduling flexibility before you complete project schedule

**Critical activities**
- activities on the critical path
- For all critical activities, ES = LS and EF = LF
  - no flexibility in start or finish times
  - total float is zero 

### 5C: Optimize Project Schedule

**Why?**
- Allows you to address setbacks, delays, constraints, etc
- requires using project management tools

**Scheduling compression**
- shortening of the project schedule without affecting the project scope
- alleviates the pressure of completing too many activities in one of two ways: fast-tracking & crashing

**Fast-tracking**
- process of compressing the project duration by performing some activities concurrently that were originally scheduled sequentially
- involves identifying FS relationships that could be done in parallel, either as FF, SF, or SS relationships or by adding some leads to FS activities

**Crashing**
- schedule compression method that analyzes cost and schedule trade-offs to determine how to obtain the greatest schedule compression for the least incremental cost
- involves allocating more resources to activities on the critical path in an effort to shorten their duration, thereby increasing project costs

**Crash cost plotting methods**
- techniques for analyzing the crash costs by creating a graph or a visual representation that clearly illustrates those costs

**Delaying**
- project scheduling process where activities are postponed to accommodate the availability of resources
- delaying resource: the first resource on an activity that allows the activity to be delayed 

### 5D: Create a schedule baseline

**Why?**
- Schedule baseline is used to get approval for project schedule
