### Summary
- Web APIs turn software into reusable bricks that can be used over a network with the HTTP protocol.
- APIs are interfaces for developers who build the applications consuming them.
- API design matters for all APIsâ€”public or private.
- Poorly designed APIs can be underused, misused, or not used at all, and even unsecure.
- Designing a good API requires that you take the whole context of the application into consideration, not only the interface itself.
