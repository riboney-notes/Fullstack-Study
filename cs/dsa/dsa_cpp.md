### 1.3 Intro to Recursion

- Recursive
  - describes a function that is defined in terms of itself
- Base case
  - value for which the recursive function is directly known without resorting to recursion
- Fundamental Rules of Recursion:
  1. Base cases: Must feature base cases which can be solved without invoking recursive calls
  2. Making progress: Recursive calls must always be to a case that makes progress toward a base case
  3. Design rule: Assume all recursive calls work
  4. Compound interest rule: Never duplicate work by solving the same instance of a problem in separate recursive calls
