# C950 Data Structures and Algorithms 2

## 2 - Algorithm analysis

### 2.1 Relation between data structures and algorithms

- Algorithmns to implement operations (i.e. insert, remove, etc) performed on data structure are specific to each data structure
  - Appending an item to a linked list requires a different algorithm than appending an item to an array

- Algorithms utilize data structures to store and organize data during algorithm execution

### 2.2 Constant time operations

- constant time operation
  - operation that for a given processor, always operates in the same amount of time, regardless of input values
  - algorithm analysis describes runtime int terms of constant time operation rather than time since execution time can be affected by processor
  - Multiple constant time operations can be collectively be considered as 1 constant time operations

- identifying constant time operations
  - Common constant time operations
    - Additions, substractions, multiplication, and division of fixed size numerical values
      - although these operations differ in execution time, they take the same amount of time (constant) regardless of the operand values   
    - variable assignment
    - comparison of 2 fixed size data values
    - array read/write at a particular index
    - A loop with constant number of iterations
      - a loop with variable number of iterations is not a constant time operation since it can take longer or shorter depending on the number of iterations
