## CH 4 Design I

- Data structure
  - Refers to the data stored in computer's main memory (RAM)

- Procedural vs OOP

> The focus of procedural programming is to break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines, whereas in object-oriented programming it is to break down a programming task into objects that expose behavior (methods) and data (fields) using interfaces. The most important distinction is that while procedural programming uses procedures to operate on data structures, object-oriented programming bundles the two together, so an object, which is an instance of a class, operates on its “own” data structure.

- Polymorphism
  - creating functions for object's whose exact type is not known until runtime

- 4 principles of OOP
  - Encapsualtion
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
