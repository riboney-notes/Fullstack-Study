## CH 4 Design I

- Data structure
  - Refers to the data stored in computer's main memory (RAM)

- Procedural vs OOP
  - procedural programming 
    -  break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines
    -  uses procedures to operate on data structures
  -  OOP programming
    -   break down a programming task into objects that expose behavior (methods) and data (fields) using interfaces
    -   combines procedures and data structures together

- Polymorphism
  - creating functions for object's whose exact type is not known until runtime
  - runtime polymorphism
    - where the overridden method is called instead of the original method
  - compile-time polymorphism
    - method overloading, where you have methods with same name but different number or types of arg 

- 4 principles of OOP
  - Encapsulation
    - creation of self-contained modules (Classes) that bind procedures to its data members
    - data is kept private and access to it is done through functions which defines the rules for how the data is treated 
    - hides inner workings and details
  - Inheritance
    - enables the structure and methods of a class to be passed down the class hierarchy
    - enables code reuse
  - Polymorphism
    - enables creating procedures for objects whose exact type is not known until runtime 
  - Abstraction
    - provides simplified interface and encapsulation
